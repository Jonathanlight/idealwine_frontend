This is absolutely possible to do. You can change the delivery country within your account before bidding or buying and have your orders delivered to your country of choice. If you regularly order to several different delivery countries, you can create a new account for each country. If you are already a Privilege or Club member, we would be more than happy to upgrade your new account to the same membership status. Do not hesitate to contact us at info@idealwine.com with the details of your new account (log-in name or email address) so that we can put the changes in place. However, we can no longer change the delivery country once an order has been placed. Changing the delivery country has a direct effect on the taxes applied and therefore, on the declarations iDealwine and our sellers need to make to the French authorities. Changing the final destination of a lot may put both iDealwine and our sellers in fiscal danger. We thank you in advance for your understanding on this point."

In order to take advantage of postponing an order, the payment for your first order must have been completed immediately. Shipment fees will be due when your grouped order is sent.This option should not be confused with the option to store your wines for 30 days. Note that there is no limit on the number of bottles you can order. Shipment costs are calculated based on delivery brackets. For example, a full package is made up of 12 bottles maximum or 6 magnums. Each bottle above this number will be charged according to the corresponding delivery bracket, adding one or more packages to your shipment. To avail of this option, choose ‘Postpone delivery/combine order’ then ‘Continue’: We recommend you use the “deferred delivery” option if you believe the temperature not to be right for transporting wine or if you will be absent. Once you are ready to receive your order, simply log into your account and pay the shipment fee. If you have exceeded the 30 days of free storage, supplementary fees will have to be paid (€0.06 per day and per bottle). <h4>Please note: </h4><br>If you opt for immediate delivery, we cannot interrupt the preparation of your order."

          "content": "<h4>How do iDealwine’s auctions work?</h4> Our auctions only take place online on the iDealwine website. At the exact moment of the sale closing, the final person offering the highest bid on a lot is the one who wins it. To participate in an auction, simply go to the lot that interests you and indicate the highest price you are willing to pay for it. iDealwine fixes a reserve price (a minimum price) on each lot. This price corresponds to the lowest estimate made by our team during their evaluation of the seller’s bottles. Alternatively, the wine can be put up for sale without a reserve price, with €1 as the starting price. During the bids placed by different interested buyers, the price increases by steps known as ‘bidding increments’. The bidding increment corresponds to the minimum amount needed to make a higher bid. For example, if a lot is priced at less than €50, the minimum bidding increment is of €3; if the bottle is priced at between €50 and €100, the minimum bidding increment is of €5. The bidding increments are as follows: <table> <tbody><tr> <th>Auction price</th> <th>Bidding increment</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Price &lt; €50</td> <td>€3</td> </tr> <tr> <td>€50&lt; Price &lt; €100</td> <td>€5</td> </tr> <tr> <td>€100 &lt; Price &lt; €300</td> <td>€10</td> </tr> <tr> <td>€300 &lt; Price &lt; €500</td> <td>€20</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Price &gt; €500</td> <td>€50</td> </tr> <tr> <td>€500 &lt; Price &lt; €2000</td> <td>€50</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Price &gt; €2000</td> <td>€100</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <h4>What is the maximum bid?</h4> You have the possibility to preset the maximum you are willing to bid for a lot. This maximum bid (not visible to other bidders) will only be reached if others bid against you. Your bid will be increased automatically until the maximum you set is reached without you having to follow the lot. In order to set a maximum bid, click on the “Maximum Bid” button on the lot you are interested in. When you arrive at the highest price you are willing to bid for the lot, click on the “Confirm” button. Your maximum bid will only be reached if there is competition for the lot. <h4>System to automatically extend auctions – \"Overtime bidding\"</h4>When a bidder places a bid in the final 3 minutes of an auction (the time and date of closing are listed in the \"Our Auctions\" menu), the catalogue is automatically extended by <strong>3 minutes</strong>. <br>If another bidder places a bid in the 30 seconds before the new closing time, the catalogue is automatically extended by <strong>30 seconds</strong>. This system of extending the auction closing time by 30 seconds can be repeated <strong>9 times</strong>, meaning that the maximum time auctions can be extended by cannot exceed 7 minutes and 30 seconds.<h4>Where do the wines up for auction come from?</h4>The wines up for sale come from cellars belonging to great wine enthusiasts across Europe. These owners contacted iDealwine to obtain an estimate for their bottles and decided to consign their collection through our website. iDealwine, through its affiliate IWA Auction (approved by the Conseil des Ventes) is today the no.1 platform of its kind in France and, more broadly, in Europe for wine auctions. <h4>Where are the wines being auctioned kept?</h4>The wines up for auction at iDealwine, which come from the collections of European wine enthusiasts, are first transported to iDealwine’s appraisal department, either by the consignor or by iDealwine’s specialist team, who collect them in person. Once they have been expertly appraised (assessment, verification, description, photographs), the wines are then stored in a warehouse with controlled temperature and humidity levels throughout the sale period. Once they’ve been auctioned, they are sent directly to the buyer. <h4>Do I need to do anything before bidding?</h4> During an auction, it is free to bid but this is irreversible. To bid, you have to already be signed up as a member of iDealwine and have entered your preferred payment method. <h4>How do I know if I’ve won a bid?</h4> If, before the closure of a sale, your bid is exceeded by another bidder, you will be informed via email. You can continue bidding on a lot until the end of an auction. At the end of every auction, you will receive an email detailing the results for each lot you’ve placed a bid on, and the price at which you’ve won it, if this is the case. <h4>Important:</h4> This email does not allow you to immediately complete your order. For this, you have to wait for all the auctions happening that day to close. At the end of a sale in which you’ve made several purchases, iDealwine groups together your winning bids in one order and writes you an email entitled “Result of your order”. This email summing up your purchases will be sent at the end of the day. It’s at this point that you’ll be invited to complete your payment and choose your preferred delivery/collection method. <h4>At what point do I pay for my auction wins?</h4>At the end of a sale in which you’ve made one or several purchases, iDealwine groups together your winning bids in one order and send you an email entitled “Result of your order”. It’s at this point that you’ll be invited to complete your payment and choose your preferred delivery/collection method. NB – In some circumstances, you can group together this order with other purchases made on the site, whether this be another auction or a fixed-price sale. <h4>Can I sell some of my bottles as well?</h4> Yes, of course! The first thing to do is send us a list of the wines you’d like to consign in order to obtain a price estimate. Ask for a <a class=\"liens\" href=\"/uk/sell-my-wines/\">price estimate</a> and find out more about <a class=\"liens\" href=\"/uk/sell-my-wines/\">selling your wines </a>with iDealwine <h4>How is the iDealwine Price Estimate calculated?</h4>iDealwine’s Price Estimate service is free for all users signed up to the site. The prices, updated every week, accurately reflect the evolution of the market. iDealwine keeps a record of all the auction results from the site. As well as this, we keep track of all the results from the biggest wine auction houses in France. Every week these results add to our extensive database of price estimates. The estimate given corresponds to price attained in the auction house, in other words the auction hammer price, increased by the auctioneer fees. The estimate takes into account the results of the main auctions in France as well as iDealwine’s online sales. Do you own or seek a wine that doesn’t have an entry in our database? Do you want to know its value? You can ask for a personalised response from our team of experts: estimate@idealwine.com"
