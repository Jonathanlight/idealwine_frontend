  "titlePart1": "Why choose wine or spirits as a corporate gift?",
  "contentPart1": "Grands crus, older vintages, large formats, Champagne, whiskies, Cognacs, Armagnacs, rare wines, or simply a good bottle - the choice of corporate gifts is so vast that you’re bound to find the perfect bottle, whoever the person and whatever the context. Wines and spirits are an excellent idea for a corporate gift, culturally suitable on almost every continent – you can say so much with wine! Tasting wine is both a pleasure and an educational experience. We like to sum it up as a picture of indulgence, conviviality and warmth. A symbol of France’s culture, from savoir-faire to joie de vivre. Wine as a corporate gift conveys both luxury and the idea of artisan-produced products. A present with many connotations, then, and perfect as a corporate gift, where the goal is generally to express thanks and maintain strong relationships.",
