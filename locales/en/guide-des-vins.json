  "description1": "Central Europe and the mediterranean region are the birthplace of modern winemaking where more than 50 countries produce wine where no two are alike. Vines grow best in temperate climates, between 30° and 50° latitude. We also have in-depth guides to France’s main wine regions: Burgundy, Bordeaux, Champagne, Rhone, and Loire. There are also guides to non-French regions including Italy, Spain Germany and further afield.",
