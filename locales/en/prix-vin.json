      "text1": "<strong>The iDealwine Auction Price Estimate®</strong> is, today, the ultimate reference in the wine auction market to find the current price of a bottle.",
      "text2": "The iDealwine Auction Price Estimate</strong> is based on a unique database of more than 3 million prices registered in French auctions since 1992.",
      "text3": "All price estimates are updated weekly according to the latest results, and the iDealwine Price Estimate includes the buyer's fees deducted at auction. The buyer can therefore obtain a realistic estimation of the price they will have to pay in order to buy the wine.\nThe seller can obtain an estimation of the price they will gain from the sale (in order to do so, it's necessary to deduct the fees from iDealwine Price Estimate).",
      "text4": "This estimate is calculated using an algorithm created by iDealwine in 2000. Unlike most comparison websites, which calculate the price of a wine based on just its current market price (not necessarily the price it is sold at), <strong>the iDealwine Price Estimate®</strong> calculates an average from recent transactions at auction.",
      "text5": "<strong>The iDealwine Price Estimate</strong> is used by almost 500,000 wine enthusiasts worldwide and is often mentioned in the media, including in La Revue du Vin de France, Bettane+Desseauve, The Drinks Business, the TV programme Intégrale Placement on the French news channel BFMTV and the Boursorama website."
