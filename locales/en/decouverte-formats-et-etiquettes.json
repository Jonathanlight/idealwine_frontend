  "part1_h2": "THE DIFFERENT BOTTLE FORMATS",
  "part1_p1": "The bottle plays an important role in how a wine ages. Moving on from a bottles spherical shape, it was redesigned in the 18th century to the cylindrical shape we know today to aid storage and preservation (due to better contact between the wine and the cork. There are different bottle formats. In general, the larger the size of the bottle, the longer the wine can be stored. Because of this, a half-bottle will reach its uncorking window a lot quicker than a magnum.\n\nThis difference is due to the way oxygen reacts differently depending on the volume of wine present.  Each region has its own bottle shape. The Bordeaux bottle (a straight-sided bottle with high shoulders) is the most popular one. Burgundy and the Rhône Valley use heavier, wider bottles. Meanwhile, Alsace bottles are longer and thinner.",

  "part2_h2": "LEVEL OF WINE IN THE BOTTLE",
  "part2_p1": "The level of a wine in the bottle is a crucial element in determining its quality, how it was preserved and the how air-tight and leak-proof the cork is.<br>When ageing wine, the cork should be airtight and allow some evaporation. Regularly checking the level of the bottles is a an excellent way to <br> assess the quality of the cork. Generally speaking, the level in the bottle reflects how the state of the wine.",
  "part3_h2": "RECORKING BOTTLES",
  "part3_p1": "Over time, a cork will lose its airtightness which endangers the quality of the wine. It can therefore be necessary to change a cork every <a name=\"etiquette\"></a>30 years. This delicate operation is often carried out by the largest and greatest producers. Undertaken by the cellar master, reconditioning a bottle is an important step for its survival. The new cork generally carries the year the wine was made as well as the year it was recorked.  The bottle will then be recapped and given a new label.",
  "part4_h1": "THE LABEL",
  "part4_p1": "When buying a wine, a wine lover is not only confronted with a choice from a from an incredibly rich and diverse range, but they also have to know how to read a label,  which in turn has to respect the legislation in the country of origin. It supplies a lot of information about the wine. <br>Up until 1728, transporting wine in anything but a barrel was not allowed and there was no label as such because barrels were marked simply with stencils. Placing labels on bottles started at the end of the 18th century. The 19th century then became the golden age for labels as they were geniuine works of art. At the time, some Bordeaux merchants used their own labels for wines that they aged and bottled. Baron Philippe de Rothschild created a tide of change when he started bottling the wine himself at the château in 1924. This was mentioned on the label guaranteed the origin of the bottles that had been missing up to this point.",

  "part4_h3_1": "Name of wine",
  "part4_h3_p1": "The name of the producer is an indicator of the quality of a wine. In long-standing winemaking regions, a property is consider a brand. Regions from outside of Europe also have estates producing a wide range of wines from different varieties. The name of the producer or the grape variety are more commonly seen on the label instead is what guarantees quality.",
  "part4_h3_2": "The vintage",
  "part4_h3_p2": "The vintage is the year the grapes were harvested but it is not obligatory to mention on the label. Until the end of the 19th century, a wine’s vintage was written on the label by hand. For Champagne bottle, which are generally produced from a blend of several vintages, only exceptional years are turned into a single-vintage Champagne. On very old bottles, the vintage could have warn off or faded. Some producers like to stamp the cork with the vintage too.",
  "part4_h3_3": "Origin of the wine",
  "part4_h3_p3": "It is mandatory that the label mentions where the country where the wine was produced. You might also see the name and the location of the vineyard plot on the label. This is the case in Burgundy in particular. The label also states the category that the wine falls into (table wine, regional wine, protected designation of origin).",
  "part4_h3_4": "Name of the producer",
  "part4_h3_p4": "This is particularly important in Burgundy as several producers can work on the same vineyard plots in this region. The producer’s name is also stated on wine from beyond Europe.",
  "part4_h3_5": "Bottling location",
  "part4_h3_p5": "In France as well as in most other wine-producing countries, legislation stipulates that the bottling location has to mentioned on the label. In 1924, the owner of Château Mouton Rothschild started bottling wine on the premises. Since 1969, this practice has become institutionalised and enthusiasts prefer it when the producers bottle their wines themselves. Wine merchants can also bottle wine that they’ve sourced from several regions. If this task has been carried out by a cooperative, the label can sometimes say “bottled at the property”.<br><br>When buying at action, it is also best to carefully look at the state of the label. The humidity which has to be present in cellars inevitably has an effect on a bottle’s label as it’s made of paper after all. Some producers will change the label for a new one when asked. During an auction, experts have to states whether a label has deteriorated or been replaced in the auction catalogues. A damaged label could reduce the price by 50% for some grand crus.",
