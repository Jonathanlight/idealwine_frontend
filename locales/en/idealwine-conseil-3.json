  "p1": "At iDealwine, we believe its possible to buy wine that you love without losing sight of future investment potential. The finest wine collections can do both. Bear in mind that buying wine purely to speculate on its future value is quite risky. Not only because it goes against everything we cherish in wine culture, but also because buying wine that we do not know or love is a sure fire way to make a bad investment. We advise creating a wine collection comprised of bottles you love. Buy the highest quality wine you can afford and educate yourself on wine, wine regions, rising stars in the wine world, and deepen your knowledge on different vintages. If you can, try to visit wineries, meet the winemakers, get to know other wine enthusiasts and learn from them. If, one day, you want to sell your wine - for financial reasons or if your preferences have changed - you can sell some or all of your collection knowing that you made sound choices. In our over 20 years experience buying and selling find wine online, we have observed that the wines with the greatest appreciation in value were never originally bought for wine investment purposes. Sometimes, we come across wine enthusiasts who have simply been too enthusiastic and have collected too much wine. Their cellars are full to the brim of wines at their peak and so they decide to resell part of their collection, which can often turn out to be a lucrative decision.",
