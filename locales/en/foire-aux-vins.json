  "titlePart1": "The story behind the Foire aux Vins",
  "contentPart1": "The Foire aux Vins is an unmissable date in any French wine lover's calendar, eagerly awaited every year for the opportunity it offers to get bargains. It dates back to the 4th November 1973, when major supermarket chain E. Leclerc launched the first “Foire Aux Vins”.   While these days, it's easy to find wine – and even fine wines – in supermarkets, this wasn't the case a few decades ago. There were only 'vins de table', wines generally considered to be fairly poor quality. Driven by the ambition to make wine more accessible to the general public, household name E. Leclerc decided to launch a wine fair, the Foire aux Vins, and the rest is history! It has continued to flourish in France and has expanded to every corner of the wine internet.  It has become a date in the diary for many wine lovers and iDealwine is glad to see it gain momentum. Not just a September wine sale, iDealwine’s Foire aux Vins is the fruit of long months and year’s of hard work maintaining excellent relationships with producers in order to offer a truly curated selection of our favourite wines, all at the best prices.",

  "titlePart4": "IDEALWINE’S FOIRE AUX VINS – WHAT THEY EXPERTS SAY",
  "contentPart4": "“Some websites have specialised in a high end Foire Aux Vins […] iDealwine[…] is one of them, from the highly-sought after estates to the “ready to drink” vintages”. “Challenges” Magazine, 1st September 2022 <br> for so long, the major pitfall of the Foire Aux Vins has been the saturation of wines that are too young to drink, that needed a few years ageing before being opened. That has changed, and one can now find a number of wines that are “ready to drink”, young fruity and smooth […]. But also a lot of older vintages, now at their peak. […] its with some of the online retailer that you can find some of the finest examples of wines that are in their drinking window, namely at iDealwine.” Philippe Richard, L’Express, 15th September 2022 <br>  Whether you’re a long-time wine enthusiast or freshly converted, you’ll no doubt want to treat yourself to a few bottles at this year’s Foire aux Vins. To be as direct about it as possible, French specialist in wine auctions iDealwine has selected 19 wines for Capital readers, from their 160 bottles in the special offers, where they have a number of additional promotions on. Bottle price varies from 9 to 79 euro. “We’re looking for the hidden gems, but not only the latest wines to enter the market but also in mature vintages, we know that your discerning readers will be on the lookout for wines that aged” says Cyrille Jomand, CEO at iDealwine.
