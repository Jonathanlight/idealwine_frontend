  "text": "The type of grape used to produce a wine effects, to a certain extent, its flavour characteristics. There are many grape varieties stemming from the original Vitis Vinifera. The best grape varieties have been selected for the character they give to wine. For most found in Europe, they remain attached to wine growing traditions that have been around for centuries. In certain regions, legislation stipulates which varieties or blends are allowed and the quantities allowed are strictly defined (for example, the Pinot Noir allowed in Côte d'Or for Bourgogne rouges, Chardonnay for Bourgogne blancs, etc.). Numerous producers in the New World grow some traditional varieties and sell the wines under the name of the variety. In France, the variety is sometimes mentioned on the label of some wines coming from the IGP areas.",
